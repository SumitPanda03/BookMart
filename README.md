## About The Project

BookMart is a responsive web application that serves as an online platform for managing book-related operations. This project is built with a versatile tech stack including HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Book Management:** Administrators can perform real-time operations such as creating, editing, and deleting books, providing complete control over the book catalog.

- **Intuitive User Interface:** Books are displayed in both table and card formats, offering users a choice in how they interact with the catalog. This enhances the user experience and makes browsing a breeze.

- **Loading Animations:** To improve user experience during asynchronous operations, we've incorporated spinner loading animations. These animations inform users when the site is awaiting data, ensuring a smooth interaction.

- **SnackBar Notifications:** When performing any operation, the application provides real-time feedback using SnackBar notifications. These notifications keep users informed of the outcome of their actions.

- **Dockerized Deployment:** We've fully Dockerized the application, making it easy to deploy and scale. This ensures that your BookMart application can be efficiently hosted in a containerized environment.
